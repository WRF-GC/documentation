This section discusses:

* Setting up the domain using WPS's ``geogrid.exe`` tool.
* Processing the meteorological initial and boundary conditions by downloading, running WPS's ``ungrib.exe``, and ``metgrid.exe``.
* Basic configuration of WRF-GC using the ``namelist.input``.
* Using WRF's ``real.exe`` to prepare input before adding in chemical initial/boundary conditions.
