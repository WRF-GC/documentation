Running environment
-------------------

What are the system requirements for WRF-GC?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Linux-based system, either on your local cluster or cloud services. Software requirements are: a Fortran/C compiler (Intel or GNU GCC+GFortran), MPI, HDF5, netCDF (with netCDF Fortran).

Recommended system specifications are at least 6 CPU cores, and at least 32 GB of RAM. Storage requirements depend on the resolution of your run, but plan for generally ~2 GB per output file. Input data for GEOS-Chem and WRF meteorology is also necessary, and may be around hundreds of GB.

Can I run WRF-GC on my own computer?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generally we recommend running on a computing cluster. If this is not possible, cloud services such as AWS may also be available.

If you want to test WRF-GC locally, a Linux system with at least 8 *recent* (consumer CPUs: Intel Haswell, 4th-generation Core; AMD Ryzen) CPU cores, 32 GB of memory is recommended. However, running on your own computer may be extremely slow and only recommended for debugging.

I want to build a cluster for my lab to run WRF-GC. What do you recommend?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hardware is ever-changing, but both recent AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon processors will work. If you are using an AMD system, you may want to use GNU compilers for better performance. Storage capacity is generally the more, the better, because WRF-GC outputs are fairly large as they include the 220+ species and all met fields computed by WRF and GEOS-Chem.

Input
-----

What are the typical input files for running WRF-GC?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Configuration:**

* ``namelist.input`` - the configuration file (namelist) for WRF-GC. Most options are configured here.
* ``HEMCO_Config.rc`` - the HEMCO configuration file, for chemistry emissions.
* ``input.geos`` - only used to specify some input files paths for Fast-JX.

**Input data:**

* ``met_em.*`` files for meteorology boundary conditions: Generated by the WRF pre-processor system (WPS) based on reanalysis fields (e.g., GFS, FNL) 
* ``wrfinput_d01`` and ``wrfbdy_d01``: Initial and boundary condition files for WRF-GC (both meteorology and chemistry). Generated by ``real.exe``, then chemical initial/boundary conditions are added to these files using a tool like ``mozbc``. See :ref:`How do I generate chemical initial/boundary conditions?`
* Emissions inputs specified in paths within ``HEMCO_Config.rc``.
* Essential chemistry input files specified within ``input.geos``.


How do I generate chemical initial/boundary conditions?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WRF-GC is a regional model. Boundary conditions from a global model are generally required. Initial conditions can be provided by a WRF-GC run or other global models.

You can use MOZART4-GEOS5, CAM-chem, or GEOS-Chem as input for initial/boundary conditions.

The general process is as follows:

* Identify which data source you want to use as ic/bc.
* Set-up WRF-GC, and run ``real.exe`` to generate ``wrfinput_d01`` (initial conditions), and ``wrfbdy_d01`` (boundary conditions)
* Prepare ic/bc inputs into a netCDF format accepted by ``mozbc``. (`mozbc for WRF-GC is located here <https://github.com/fengx7/mozbc_for_WRFv3.9>`_)
* Use `mozbc` to add these inputs to ``wrfinput_d01`` and/or ``wrfbdy_d01`` files.
* Run the WRF-GC model.

**GEOS-Chem input:** Refer to the getting started guide. `A MATLAB script <https://github.com/fengx7/WRF-GC-GCC_ICBC>`_ will process global GEOS-Chem outputs to netCDF files accepted by ``mozbc``, which are then generated into WRF(-GC) initial/boundary files.

Can I nudge the input meteorology data?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes. The process is similar to WRF, or WRF-Chem. More details soon.

Can I use other emission inventories?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes. You want to edit the HEMCO configuration file (``HEMCO_Config.rc``), like in GEOS-Chem. Generally, all emission inventories supported by GEOS-Chem/HEMCO are supported in WRF-GC, because the species list is the same.

For emission inventories from WRF-Chem (e.g., prepared by `prep_chem_sources`), these inventories need to be ported to HEMCO to function with WRF-GC. We do not support WRF-Chem style emissions (i.e., "auxinput05") within WRF-GC.

Running and configuration
-------------------------

Where are the configuration files for WRF-GC?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the run directory. Generally, ``WRFV3/run`` or ``WRF/run``. The configuration files you want to use are ``namelist.input`` (WRF namelist - configures both WRF and chemistry options), and ``HEMCO_Config.rc`` (to configure HEMCO emissions).

``input.geos`` also holds the paths to some essential chemistry input files. You generally only need to edit the paths in this file.

.. note::
	While ``input.geos``, ``HISTORY.rc``, and ``HEMCO_Diagn.rc`` files, familiar to GEOS-Chem users, are also in the WRF-GC run directory, they should generally not be modified. To control WRF-GC, use the WRF namelist ``namelist.input``.

.. warning::
	Be careful to back up your configuration files. Every WRF-GC recompile **will reset the namelist and configuration files.**
	

Can I run the model in multiple segmented runs?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes. WRF will generate restart files based on the namelist configuration's ``restart_interval``.


Output
------

How can I configure output?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``history_interval`` in WRF's ``namelist.input``.

What is the output format? What are some tools to process them?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output is in ``wrfout_`` netCDF format used by WRF, and WRF-Chem. As such, tools to process WRF and WRF-Chem outputs may be useful for WRF-GC with some species name modifications.

Can I output GEOS-Chem diagnostics?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Limited support is available for this at this time. Generally, only very specific diagnostics such as wet deposition loss rates are available.

Planeflight diagnostics are not available at this time but may be developed in the future.


Advanced
--------

Does WRF-GC support MPI or OpenMP parallelization?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At present, only MPI. OpenMP routines were removed during the development of WRF-GC.

Does WRF-GC support parallel I/O by WRF?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Yes, but HEMCO does not use parallel I/O. You do not need PNETCDF to run WRF-GC normally.
