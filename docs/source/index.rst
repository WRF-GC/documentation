Welcome to WRF-GC!
===================================

**WRF-GC** (WRF coupled with GEOS-Chem chemistry) is an online coupled model based on the regional meteorology model, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting Model), and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model.

This is the new web-based WRF-GC documentation. We are actively working on adding content.

Check out `the WRF-GC website <https://fugroup.org/index.php/WRF-GC>`_ at the `Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Group at SUSTech <https://fugroup.org/>`_
